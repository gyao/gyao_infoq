In a recent [news report][10] CNN has revealed a translated Toyota memo which links problems of the car manufacturer regarding an electronic acceleration concern to a software issue. When even news magazines pick up such stories, this shows the growing importance of software for embedded systems. 

在最近一篇[新闻报道][10]中，CNN公布了一份丰田公司内部备忘录的译本，其中提及这家汽车制造商将一个对电子加速部件可能引发汽车故障的担心归因于的软件问题。当新闻媒体都开始报道这样的消息时，表明了软件在嵌入式系统中变得愈加重要。

It maybe over 6 years when the problem appeared in the Lexus Model 460 as well as the Toyota Tundra. Nonetheless, the message shows the increasing relevance of software engineering for embedded systems. Embedded systems and not enterprise systems as many people assume contain most of the software built today. Approximately 50% and continuously increasing is the contribution of software to embedded systems such as power plants, medical devices, planes, automotive. As a consequence, software bugs can have a huge impact. 

这个问题可能6年前就出现在Lexus 460车型上，丰田Tundra车型也可能有同样的问题。尽管如此，这则消息显示了软件工程和嵌入式系统之间愈加紧密的关联。很多人认为嵌入式系统和非企业系统是如今人们构建最多的软件系统。这一比例约为50%，并在持续上升，因为人们仍在不断的为在诸如发电厂、医疗设备、飞机和汽车中使用的嵌入式系统编写软件。其结果是，软件缺陷能够造成巨大影响。

In the case of Toyota, the following problem appeared in the car as the translation of an internal Toyota Memo shows 

在丰田汽车的报道中，丰田公司内部备忘录译本中披露出的汽车控制问题是：

> The cruise control activates by itself at full throttle when the accelerator pedal position sensor is abnormal. 

> 在油门最大时，加速踏板位置传感器异常会导致巡航控制器被自身激活。


According to CNN: 

CNN报道说：

> Software glitches were an early suspect in the rash of reports of sudden, unintended accelerations reported in Toyota vehicles in 2010, some of which caused severe accidents and several fatalities. But both Toyota and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded that electronics were not at fault, instead blaming bad floor mats, sticky accelerator pedals and, in some cases, driver error. 

> 最初怀疑软件故障导致丰田汽车突然非受控加速，从而引发严重事故和多人死亡的事件早在2010年就被报道。然而丰田汽车公司和国家高速公路交通安全管理局共同得出结论，电子系统没有故障，而将上述几起事故归因于汽车地毯，粘性的加速踏板，以及在某些事故中司机的人为过错。


It needs to be mentioned, though, that Toyota does deny this problem has ever appeared and that the memo has been translated in an incorrect way. Moreover, any problems, according to the company, had been fixed before production. 

特别需要说明的是，尽管CNN如此报道，丰田汽车公司坚决否认（旗下的汽车）出现这一问题，宣称这份备忘录的翻译是错误的。此外，丰田汽车公司还宣布任何问题都已在批量生产前得到解决。

Toyota is only one example that shows the relevance of software architecture and engineering in modern products and solutions. Even companies that were hardware-centric in the past need to adapt to the fact that software is now becoming the main constituent of their systems. As a consequence, software architecture needs much more emphasize in system engineering contexts where so far hardware and business aspects such as bill of material had been the main drivers. 

丰田汽车公司的案例只是一个例子，显示出软件架构和软件工程与现代工业生产和工业解决方案之间的紧密关联。即便有些公司过去是以硬件生产为中心的，也需要面对软件如今正在成为它们系统的组成部分这一事实。其结果是，需要在系统工程的背景下更加强调软件架构，因为过去硬件和业务方面，如材料清单等，才是主要的驱动力。
